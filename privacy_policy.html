                <p>In order to exercise any of Your rights under the CCPA/CPRA, and if You are a California resident, You can contact Us.</p>
                <p>Only You, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that You authorize to act on Your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to Your personal information.</p>
                <p>Your request to Us must:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorized representative</li>
                <li>Describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows Us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot respond to Your request or provide You with the required information if We cannot:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Verify Your identity or authority to make the request</li>
                <li>And confirm that the personal information relates to You</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will disclose and deliver the required information free of charge within 45 days of receiving Your verifiable request. The time period to provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary and with prior notice.</p>

                <p>For data portability requests, We will select a format to provide Your personal information that is readily usable and should allow You to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
                
                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
                
                <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>

                <h2>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h2>
                <p>As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a Consumer's personal information by the Business to a third party for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>
                <p>We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly understood. We do allow Service Providers to use Your personal information for the business purposes described in Our Privacy Policy, for activities such as advertising, marketing, and analytics, and these may be deemed a sale under CCPA/CPRA.</p>
                <p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of Your personal information. Once We receive and confirm a verifiable consumer request from You, we will stop selling Your personal information. To exercise Your right to opt-out, please contact Us.</p>
                <p>The Service Providers we partner with (for example, our analytics or advertising partners) may use technology on the Service that sells personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA law. If you wish to opt out of the use of Your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes and these potential sales as defined under CCPA/CPRA law, you may do so by following the instructions below.</p>
                <p>Please note that any opt out is specific to the browser You use. You may need to opt out on every browser that You use.</p>
                
                <h3>Mobile Devices</h3>
